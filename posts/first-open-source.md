title: "My first Two Open Source PRs Just got Merged to a Defi Project!"

<h3>Have to start somewhere.</h3>

It's been a goal of mine to understand how to fix issues within a GitHub organization, so I decided to jump in head first and get started.

<h5>"Dev Protocol lets GitHub users tokenize their OSS projects in a few clicks."</h5>

I think they put it best. I've been following this project for a while, and I love what they're doing. Open source funding has long been a consistent pain point for the open source community and Dev Protocol seeks to remedy that through cryptocurrency incentivization models, e.g. allowing fans of certain OSS to stake their crypto for the repo and generate a % APY interest reward for both themselves and the repository owner or team. Stakers in the future will be further incentivized through Patreon-esque mechanics.

Success! PRs successfully merged, issues closed. While these were just minor front end visual bugs or improvements, it felt good to create a PR for a real issue on a real open source project, especially one in the realm of blockchain and cryptocurrency.

<em>Many more to come.</em>
