In my last weeks of Lambda we were given the opportunity to contribute to an actual product that consisted of a large codebase maintained by fellow Lambda students. I was placed on a team with four other developers half of which specialized in full stack web dev and the other half data science.

We were to report to our stake holders for Story Squad, they had the final say in every feature we shipped and were there to offer guidance along the way. In building the software out we were able to ship three key features: 

- Making the userflow experience more intuitive
- Implementing an emoji feedback component
- Adding new backend tables for stories/chapters

To build out these features we were given a lot of freedom to decide how we'd like to work. My team and I decided to squad-program for most of our time in labs, which offered a unique perspective on my peer's progress as software engineers. I learned a lot by leading my teammates and pushing myself to communicate as effectively as possible. Additionally, being able to work with a group of other engineers with whom I could ask questions of was a huge help for me. I love learning new things and talking to people, so being on a team with people who have different skill sets than me was great - I was able to ask my teammates how their code worked and vice versa. Overall, it was a great learning experience in respect to software engineering and working on a team.

To implement our features and ship as fast as possible while delivering meaningful changes of clean, thought out code, we started out by just trying the app for ourselves and seeing where it felt short. From the very beginning it was obvious what was wrong with the app: it was confusing what components should be clicked on to complete all of our goals witin the app. Upon completing challenges, a player was left with a screen full of buttons with no indication as to where they should go next. To solve this and make the experience simpler and more interactive, especially considering the app was for younger children I suggested we give visual cues to direct the players where to click on the screen. These visual cues had logic that checked to see if the challenges were met and if they were, the next logical screen for them to navigate to would pop out at them. I feel this simple change carried a lot of value and made the overall user experience much better.

For emoji feedback the team and I thought for a little bit about how it should work and what it should look like. To stay consistent with our other quality of life changes, we settled on the fact that one should be able to select and deselect emojis, the screen should be big and obvious that it's to be interacted with, and it should look fun and inviting for children of all ages. My teammate Nestor had a great idea to implement a React hook that would save us a lot of time in coding out the emojis. We had the emojis on the screen in no time and quickly wrote state logic that checked if something was clicked/submitted or not. Once the functionality was there the next step was to make the emoji feedback menu sleek in design and functionality. I wanted the background of each emoji clicked to change color, I wanted the mouse to change to a different cursor when hovering over the menu, to give a hint that it's to be played with. I used simple box shadows and gradient color scheme to give it a nice, polished, and modern look, and used some css to make the experience of using the menu feel interactive and fun.

For our backend portion I had a great time helping to implement some of the tables and figure out what should be the primary key and which table should reference what. We settled on having a stories table which had a primary key which was referenced by the chapter table. This linked the story to the chapter and let us track progress of the player and where they were in their given story. When we pushed our backend changes we kept getting 'prettier' errors which is a compiler that formats your code into a more readable, and for lack of a better word, prettier version. The issue was that when we pushed our code up to GitHub, prettier had an issue with the syntax. I helped my teammate Keean install prettier and change his IDE's default code formatter to prettier using ES6 syntax. We knocked out the backend changes in no time which gave us ample time to write up some documentation and finalize minor front end changes.

Overall my Labs experience was a great experience. I really enjoyed being able to share my ideas with a team and seeing how receptive everyone was to what I was suggesting. I utlized my communication skills, leadership skills, and listening skills to guide my team into its most productive state, suggesting changes that would let us ship the fastest. In working on a team with other students I was able to ask a lot of questions about how they work and how they would implement features. It was super interesting and fulfilling to be able to work side by side with other engineers on a common goal of shipping a product, all the while learning new things and strengthening some of my existing skills. I'm really excited to do this again in a work environment.
